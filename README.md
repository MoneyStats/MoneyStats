# MoneyStats

This project is developed with a different logic and implementations than MoneyStats [OLD] .
The idea is to develop a web applications that can allow the user to be able to keep track of his assets.
Once registered and logged in, the user will have at his disposal a series of default categories (cash, credit cards, investments, etc.), before proceeding to add the statement, he must proceed with the creation of the respective wallet, associating them according to the categories.
Subsequently, an ADMIN management screen will be implemented.

The DataBase data will be available shortly.
